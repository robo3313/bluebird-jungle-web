                <p>Bluebird Jungle was hatched in Paris in the Spring of MMXV. Conceived and created by four musicians : Yan Le Vaguerèse, Nicolas Baïetto, Tony Sullivan and Russ Hoag who had known each other and made music together for a number of years, it seemed that the time was right to form a group. Bluebird Jungle was on the wing!</p>
                <p>These four have always been and remain the core nucleus of the band but we have worked with other musicians along the way. In the early days we soon added a Croatian female singer who was to remain with us for the next two and a half years before she left to pursue her studies.</p>
                <p>In the Spring of MMXVII, I met Delphine and for the next eighteen months we worked together regularly on an alternative repertoire before she became a new member of the band in the Autumn of MMXVIII and this is the basic line-up that you will be hearing on this record.</p>
                <p>On the recordings we were fortunate enough to enjoy highly creative sessions with Aliza on vocals and Steve on harmony vocals, lap steel and electric guitar. They both made immense contributions to the recording of this album and by the time we record our second CD, Steve will have become a fully-fledged member of the band.</p>
                <p>We hope you enjoy listening to the songs. Bluebird Jungle has taken flight and left the nest!
