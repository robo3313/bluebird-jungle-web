                The low sounding drum that is sometimes capable of descending into the sepulchral regions of depth
                itself, such a vital ingredient in the performance of traditional Irish folk music. It is said that in
                order for a true bodhràn to sound as it should, it ought to “sound like thunder”. It is used sparsely on
                “Still A Mystery To Me” but its presence can still be felt.

                Mystery To Me” intro. The word ‘shruti’ means ‘micro (musical) interval’ in Hindi.

                    are tuned in unison), triangular body shape and tiny sound hole, sounds like no other plucked
                    stringed instrument. You can hear it towards the end of “Make-Believe” in company with acoustic &
                    12-string guitars and Dobro mandolin.

                    places it more in the antique rather than vintage category.

                    The one we use on the album is a pre-1930 Gibson with one unusual distinguishing feature : a ‘trap
                    door’ mechanism involving being able to open half of the back section, (which is divided into two
                    parts), thus altering the tone-colour and increasing volume, very handy in concert but we kept it
                    closed on the recording.

                    The date usually quoted for the invention of this instrument by Portugese immigrants in Hawaii,
                    (with which it is inextricably associated), is 1879. To put it fully into perspective, this was only
                    a few years before the banjo used on this album was made! The one I use on this record is a
                    beautiful tenor instrument made from koa, (the wood traditionally used to make ukuleles, indigenous
                    to Hawaii). and comes from Russ’ impressive collection of ukes. The maker’s name is Pono for whom it
                    was constructed by the Ko’olau Guitar & Ukulele Company, “handcrafted on the Island of Java”.

                <div class="instrument-description">
                    The original acoustic tambura is a fretless 4-string instrument with a very long neck, played
                    seated, usually by a lady. Its chief role is as an obligato drone accompaniment to the sitar. In
                    fact, the sitar itself originally only had three strings, hence its name : si’tar in Hindi literally
                    means ‘three strings’. The electric version is a hybrid box-shaped device that allows for precision
                    tuning and is the perfect foil for the other ‘drone’ instruments on the introduction to “Still A
                    Mystery To Me”. Russ found it in India.

                    The lap steel or Hawaiian guitar is played, as its name suggests, on the knees by sliding a solid
                    metal bar, (as opposed to a hollow bottleneck), across its strings. This model is a German-made
                    Hofner and dates from around 1950. Steve uses it on 3 tracks on the album and plays it with great
                    feeling.

                    A kind of metal washboard with an undulated surface in the shape of a tie that is slipped

                    length with thimbles attached to the player’s fingers. On this recording, Russ uses a teaspoon to
                    good effect. This instrument was a gift from a friend who bought it in New Orleans.

                A Brazilian friction drum made in California by the Gonbops company. It is played by inserting the hand
                into the drum and rubbing on a stick (which itself is inserted into the centre of the skin of the drum),
                between the thumb and index finger with the aid of a damp sponge or a piece of leather in order to make
                the skin vibrate, thus producing the sound. The cuica plays an important role in traditional Brazilian
                folk music and its inimitable sound can be heard on “Teenage Tears”.

                This one was custom built by the eminent French percussion maker, Daniel Frouvelle, who lives and works
                in the Pyrenees. It was created after mediaeval and Renaissance iconographical evidence and, most
                notably, from Marin Mersenne’s famous treatise, Harmonie Universelle, of 1636. It differs from the
                modern orchestral triangle in that it is made of solid brass and has several rings, similar to curtain
                rings, which jingle ‘in sympathy’ to the basic sound, (a ‘deader’ sound), and provide an added, lighter
                timbre, rich in harmonics. On this record, it is played alongside the cuica on “Teenage Tears”.
