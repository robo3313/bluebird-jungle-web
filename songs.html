            A song I wrote in my native town in a period when I was continuously taking cross channel ferries,
            hovercrafts, overnight trains when the guard would shout “Terminus” and you would be turfed out onto a
            middle-of-the-night platform in Le Havre or Dunkirk and you would stand freezing waiting for the next boat,
            more often than not the Saint Germain. I was virtually commuting between the two countries, the two cities,
            in a quandary as to where I wanted to live. J’ai choisi Paris.

            Summer 2009, holidaying in Rome, staying with Yan, walked from morning till night in asphyxiating
            temperatures from via Zara to the Villa Borghese, from the Colosseum to St. Peter’s Square. It was in the
            basilica that, after having taken the elevator up to the first level, my son, then only four years old,
            insisted on walking the rest of the way up to the top of the dome. We did, we were breathless, he could have

            <p>Keep on walking till the end of the day</p>
            <p>Took a flight, Alitalia, we were off to Rome</p>

            Drinking coffee with Steve in a café on Paris’ Left Bank in the fashionable Latin Quarter when Isabelle, a
            friend of ours, came over and said, “Can I come and hang out with you ? There’s a guy standing at the bar
            who keeps harassing me.” Then, intending to say,”He’s got a one track mind”, it came out as, “He’s a
            one-track man.” Steve immediately turned to me and said, “I challenge you to write a song with that title.”
            This is the result and we’ve been singing it together for most of our adult lives.

            A moment in time – everyone needs sometimes. In County Cork Ireland where it always seems
            to rain.

            <p>Riding out, out from the town</p>
            <p>There was something giving me ground</p>
            <p>Losing not a chance to make it in the very last</p>
            <p>Drying from the rain, coming down</p>
            <p>Two-faced or so the story goes</p>
            <p>Told by the girl in the evening clothes</p>
            <p>That you’re growing so wild in a country all so mild</p>
            <p>Drying from the rain, I suppose</p>
            <p>Watching the picture with no sound</p>
            <p>Seeing lots of people who come around</p>
            <p>Trying to lose not a chance to make it in the very last</p>
